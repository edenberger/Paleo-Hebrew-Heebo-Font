# Robo-PaleoHeb
## Ancient / Paleo Hebrew font

[Paleo Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet) is an ancient Hebrew script.  

The script can still be seen today in historical references, e.g. the 1 New Shekel coin, have the letters [JHD](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/יהוד_מדינתא_(מטבע))(יהד) printed on it, which addressed to Jahoda(יהודה) kingdom.  

[Dr. Kris J. Udd](https://graceu.academia.edu/KUdd/) made the original font, I placed the keys differently.  
Approved by the creator new versions are under Apache License 2.0  

I made two copies:  
- A vanilla paleo script to easily merge with other fonts
- A merged version together with Roboto

Enjoy!
