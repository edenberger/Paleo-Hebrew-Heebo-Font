# Paleo-Hebrew-Heebo-Font
Ancient / Paleo Hebrew font

[Paleo Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet) is an old Hebrew language, still exists on the 1 New Shekel coin, you will find the letters [JHD](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/יהוד_מדינתא_(מטבע))(יהד) which addressed to Jahoda(יהודה) kingdom.

Thanks to Dr. Kris J. Udd I was able to take the Paleo Hebrew characters he made from [here](http://www.bibleplaces.com/paleo_hebrew_fonts/), merge them with Meir Sadan [Heebo](https://github.com/meirsadan/heebo) font and make a Paleo-Hebrew chars spread on modern Hebrew keyboard.

Enjoy!
